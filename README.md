# HealthCareCosts_Predictions_with_MLP_Model

This project utilizes a feedforward MLP neural network implemented with TF Keras API to predict health insurance expenses.
It preprocesses an insurance dataset using one-hot encoding and feature scaling.
The MLP architecture consists of densely connected layers with ReLU activation to learn complex relationships between input
features like age, BMI, gender, region, etc. and then predicts the expense output. 
Then it uses matplotlib to visualize how well predictions align with actual expenses.
